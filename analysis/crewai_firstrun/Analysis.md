Artifacts (Strategies for Optimizing Data Retrieval):

Indexing: Implement appropriate indexes to drastically reduce retrieval times.

Caching: Store frequently accessed data in memory to minimize retrieval times.

Query Optimization: Analyze and rewrite queries for more efficient execution.

Data Denormalization: Combine tables to reduce joins and improve performance where applicable.

Partitioning: Divide datasets into smaller parts to improve query performance.

Database Tuning: Regularly monitor and adjust performance settings for optimal functioning.

Load Balancing: Distribute data retrieval load across servers to enhance performance.

Asynchronous Processing: Allow tasks to continue while waiting for data retrieval, improving efficiency.

Efficient Data Structures: Tailor data structures to the nature of data and queries for better performance.

These strategies focus on enhancing efficiency and performance in data-driven applications, mirroring the principles applied in CPU design and algorithm optimization.
